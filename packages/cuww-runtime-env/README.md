# Runtime Environments for NextJs

Runtime Environment Variables for frontend applications build with NextJs. It simplifies the process of storing and managing environment variables. Forget about the hassle of storing and configuring CI/CD pipelines specifically for frontend apps, simply use kubernetes, etc.

## Features

- **Cloud-native**: Make you frontend application Cloud-native: store and manage environment variables in a centralized solution like Kubernetes.
- **Simplified configuration**: Easily configure runtime environment variables for your Next.js frontend applications.
- **Seamless integration**: Integrate into your existing Next.js projects with only 2 line of code.
- **Enhanced security**: Ensure secure handling of sensitive information by storing it in a centralized and protected environment. Keep using `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` as you get used to.
- **Effortless CI/CD**: Eliminate the need for separate CI/CD configuration for frontend apps and simplify your deployment process.
